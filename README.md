# Hello! This is Rohan :raising_hand_man:

### An Undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering with good background in ROS and Mechanical Design. 

### I'm a avid robotics student. My interests lie at the crossroads of hardware :gear:, software :computer:, electronics :trackball: and systems. There's something thrilling about the point where intelligence absolutely meets environmental interaction. What matters is...what am I going to do with it?
